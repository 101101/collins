<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Asset API is the primary interface for manipulating Collins assets. The
operations that can be performed is somewhat dependent on the status of an asset
(for instance, you can not upload new LSHW data to an asset that is Allocated).
For more information on asset states and status see the
<a href="concepts.html#status & state">Status &amp; State</a> document.

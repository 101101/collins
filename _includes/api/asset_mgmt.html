<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Most of the API endpoints that are part of the asset management API are
provisioning, power, or IPMI related. All of the asset management endpoints are
going to depend somewhat on how you have configured collins. While the API
remains consistent, the under the hood behavior of Collins will depend greatly
on configuration. For more details in provisioning, IPMI, and power
configurations see the <a href="configuration.html">configuration</a>
documentation.

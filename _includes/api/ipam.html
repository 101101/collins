<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Collins provides a fairly robust IPAM system, complete with callbacks and hooks
to drive automation for your networking devices. Address management comes in two
forms, strict and non-strict. In strict mode, addresses can only by allocated or
managed from predefined pools. The pool configuration is documented
<a href="configuration.html">here</a>. In non-strict mode, which is typically
only suitable if you don't manage your own addresses, Collins will allow you to
allocate any addresses, as long as they aren't in use.

<p>
In addition to address management (creates, deletes, etc), the Collins IPAM API
allows you to easily query this information. You can find out which pools are in
use as well as utilization statistics, you can find out which asset is using a
particular address, you can find out which assets are in a particular pool.

<p class="lead">Status and state describe the current phase of the lifecycle of an asset.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>The lifecycle (from birth to death) of an asset are described in terms of its status. The possible status values are fixed and can not be managed via the API. While all available status values are listed below, the descriptions given are primarily indiciative of their meanings for a server. A non-server asset type such as a configuration may only ever be allocate d or decommissioned, for instance. The status values described below also give some specific insight into the Tumblr intake process for hardware.
</p>

<h4 id="incomplete">Incomplete</h4>
  <p>Host not yet ready for use. It has been powered on and entered in Collins but the automated induction process is still being performed.</p>
<h4 id="new">New</h4>
  <p>Host has completed the automated induction process and is waiting for an onsite tech to complete physical intake</p>
<h4 id="unallocated">Unallocated</h4>
  <p>Host has completed intake process and is ready for use (eg available resource for provisioning into a role)</p>
<h4 id="provisioning">Provisioning</h4>
    <p>Host has started provisioning process but has not yet completed it</p>
<h4 id="provisioned">Provisioned</h4>
    <p>Host has finished provisioning and is awaiting final automated verification</p>
<h4 id="allocated">Allocated</h4>
  <p>This asset is in what should likely be considered a production state</p>
<h4 id="cancelled">Cancelled</h4>
  <p>Asset is no longer needed and is awaiting decommissioning (typically only associated with SoftLayer and other transient cloud-provided assets)</p>
<h4 id="decommissioned">Decommissioned</h4>
  <p>Asset has completed the outtake process and can no longer be managed</p>
<h4 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h4>
  <p>Asset is undergoing some kind of maintenance and should not be considered for production use</p>

<p>The status transition should not generally happen by hand. Automated processes should drive status changes, not people. In fact, the collins UI only allows you to change the status by taking an action (e.g. cancelling an asset or putting it into maintenance).</p>

<h2>State</h2>
<p>
  While the status of an asset describes where it is in a discrete lifecycle, the state describes a lifecycle specific to a status. For example,
  a server that is in maintenance may have a state of <code>HARDWARE_PROBLEM</code> or <code>HARDWARE_UPGRADE</code>. Also note that those states
  are not appropriate for healthy (non-maintenance) assets, and so these states are restricted to assets with a status of
  <code>Maintenance</code>. New states may be defined with <a href="/api.html#state">this API</a>.
</p>
<p>
  A state can be either a system state, or a non-system state. System states can not be modified or destroyed. Non-system states can be
  modified and destroyed. Via the API you can only create non-system states, although support for adding system states may be added in
  the future. A state can be bound to a status (such as the case of <code>HARDWARE_PROBLEM</code>), or can be used with any status
  (such as the case of <code>RUNNING</code>). The out of the box available states are described below.
</p>
<div id="state-table" class="accordion-body ">
  {% include states.html %}
</div>

<p>A useful example of another state could be <code>Allocated:DRAINING</code>. This state could reflect an asset is currently taking production traffic and should continue to be monitored, but signals to loadbalancers and resource managers to stop routing new jobs/requests to this asset. Once the asset is fully drained of jobs, an automated process could move it from <code>Allocated:DRAINING</code> into a <code>Maintenance</code> state to pull it out of rotation fully.</p>

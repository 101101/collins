<p class="lead">Multi-dimensional key/values for an asset</p>
<p>The most fundamentally important concept in collins is that of a tag. A tag is a key value pair, with an optional dimension index. For example, <code>PORT</code> tag has a default index of <code>0</code>, but could be N-dimensional as you define multiple <code>PORT</code> tags with different dimensions. You are not limited by a predefined set of tags for your assets! If you tag an asset with a new tag <code>FRESHNESS=9000</code>, it will be immediately available to query. If you set a new tag value using the same dimension, the old value will be overwritten. All tag changes, including deletes, are logged as part of the asset audit trail.</p>

<h2>Tag Types</h2>
<p>
  Tags can be either managed, automated, or unmanaged.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Managed</dt>
  <dd>
    Tags that are not user managable (such as CPU speed) and can only be set or changed during certain lifecycle events, such as the server intake process.
    These tags can not be changed, updated or deleted by a user. This is enforced in the software.
  </dd>
  <dt>Automated</dt>
  <dd>
    Tags that are managed by external automated processes such as server provisioning.
    Although these can technically be set/changed by users via the API, convention dictates that they should not be.
  </dd>
  <dt>Unmanaged</dt>
  <dd>
    Tags set by a user via some api interaction (most likely), but probably on a manual basis. In some cases these may be part of an automated process,
    but some user-interaction will dictate the tag value. These are typically used for things like notes, links, testing, etc.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Dimensions</h2>
<p>By default, a simple tag has the <code>"0"</code> dimension. A dimension can be any integer value (including a timestamp) and is typically used for grouping things together. You can imagine the disks of a host being described like</p>
<pre><code>{
  "0": {
    "DEV_NAME": "/dev/sda",
    "TOTAL_DISK_SPACE_BYTES": 536870912000,
    "DISK_TYPE": "SATA"
  },
  "1": {
    "DEV_NAME": "/dev/sdb",
    "TOTAL_DISK_SPACE_BYTES": 0,
    "DISK_TYPE": "CD-ROM"
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>
  This information tells you that the asset has two disks (one sata, one cd-rom) and tells you a bit about each physical disk. The value of
  the dimension in this case is just to logically group things together, and possibly to provide some ordering. You could also however
  use the dimension to represent things like port allocation (i.e. each dimension represents a port in use on the asset), or order of
  some arbitrary event where the timestamp is the dimension used. It's up to you.
</p>

<h3>Tag Conventions</h3>
<p>The flexible and free-form nature of using user-defined tags to drive automation and add semantic value to Assets in Collins dictates that users agree upon some conventions for tag usage. For example, if you use the <code>PUPPET_ENVIRONMENT</code> tag to override which puppet environment an asset will use when running puppet, external automation should be put in place to ensure environments are cleaned up after use, and that assets do not remain in non-production environments for too long.</p>

  The logs for an asset are created by both internal and external processes. There is an API available for creating new log
  entries and querying existing ones, but log entries are immutable and permanent, there is no delete support, even once an asset
  is decommissioned. These logs give you a permanent historical view of lifecycle related events such as provisions and cancellations
  as well as changes in tag values.
